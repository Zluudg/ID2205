\section{November 6th}
I have decided to base the dmdl-editor on the \texttt{mxgraph} library, which seems suitable for the situation.
It is available on https://github.com/jgraph/mxgraph and licensed under Apache V2.0, which I hope is fine (I asked
Peng about it in an email today but he has not answered yet). Most of my day was spent studying the basics of 
JavaScript and creating a basic skeleton structure for the application.

\section{November 7th}
I looked into the Canvas API featured in HTML 5 as a simpler alternative to mxgraph. After spending the day with mxgraph
I realized that the API is a bit too complicated for me and that I am probably better of using what is readily available in
plain old JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The first version of the editor that I intent to implement will feature a dropdown menu
with 3-4 blocks, an area for placing the blocks and a configuration menu for the selected instance of a block.
