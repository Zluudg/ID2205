% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

% Packages for coloring entries in the milestone table in the appendix
\usepackage{xcolor}



% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with

% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
% Do NOT use the amsbsy package under comsoc mode as that feature is
% already built into the Times Math font (newtxmath, mathtime, etc.).
% 
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath


% Select a Times math font under comsoc mode or else one will automatically
% be selected for you at the document start. This is required as Communications
% Society journals use a Times, not Computer Modern, math font.
\usepackage[cmintegrals]{newtxmath}
% The freely available newtxmath package was written by Michael Sharpe and
% provides a feature rich Times math font. The cmintegrals option, which is
% the default under IEEEtran, is needed to get the correct style integral
% symbols used in Communications Society journals. Version 1.451, July 28,
% 2015 or later is recommended. Also, do *not* load the newtxtext.sty package
% as doing so would alter the main text font.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/newtx
%
% Alternatively, you can use the MathTime commercial fonts if you have them
% installed on your system:
%\usepackage{mtpro2}
%\usepackage{mt11p}
%\usepackage{mathtime}


%\usepackage{bm}
% The bm.sty package was written by David Carlisle and Frank Mittelbach.
% This package provides a \bm{} to produce bold math symbols.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/bm





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
% \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
%\let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
%\renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\title{A Development Environment for Decomposite MAC Description Language}

\markboth{ID2205 Final Report}%
{A DE for DMDL}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In order to tackle the ever-increasing demands on wireless capacity and diversity,
Decomposite MAC Description Language (DMDL) has been developed. DMDL is a graphical
programming language that allows the user to intuitively and swiftly describe and
prototype Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols without platform dependence.
In order to embrace the platform independence of DMDL, a web-based Development Environment (DE)
has been built. The DE is thought to act as a front-end in a system that allows a user to
simulate or even implement MAC protocols with frameworks such as LabVIEW and GNU Radio and
platforms such as USRP acting as a back-end. This is arguably an important step towards a
full softwarization of the network stack and can provide much needed flexibility in developing
wireless systems. The DE is mainly used to create and export an XML file that represents the DMDL
description a protocol. The XML file will act as an intermediate file between the DE and existing
frameworks for wireless protocol development.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{W}{ireless technology} is an essential part of our everyday lives and it is
being adopted literally everywhere. High or low, big or small, wireless technology can
find applications of all kinds. From high performance cellphone base stations to low-cost,
low-energy sensor networks. The diversity of wireless systems is tremendous, to say the least,
and embracing the diversity allows the limited resource that is the Electromagnetic EM spectrum to
be used more efficiently.

The Software Defined Radio (SDR)~\cite{sdr} is a re-configurable transceiver that can be programmed
to the developer's liking entirely by software. Within the diverse field of wireless research,
it is an essential tool for prototyping and developing the protocols and systems of tomorrow.

The OSI model~\cite{osi} paints a rough picture that provides a basic understanding of
how a networking stack is implemented. It consists of seven layers that each contain different
functionalities that together realize a communication link between two networking devices. The
bottom two layers, the Physical (PHY) and Data Link (DL) layers, have traditionally been
implemented in hardware and the remaining five in software. Software implementations are generally
more flexible and easier to develop, which is desirable within a dynamic field such as wireless
research. Through the SDR, the PHY layer can be be implemented in software as well.

Before a fully softwarized network stack can be realized, a framework for defining DL functionality
is needed. An important step towards that is the softwarization of the DL sublayer
called Medium Access Control (MAC), which provides the functionality of coordination among the
nodes in order to keep interference within a wireless system down. For this,
Decomposite MAC Description Language (DMDL)~\cite{dmdl} has been developed.

By providing a web-based front-end for a DMDL Development Environment (DE) the accessibility
and platform-independence of DMDL can be boosted. Following trends such as
Platform as a Service (PaaS) or Hardware as a Service (HaaS), this project aims to take the first
step towards something that could be regarded as SDR as a Service (SDRaaS). Promoting DMDL in
this was can help achieve a softwarization of the entire network stack, which in turn promotes
diversity so that wireless systems can continue to thrive. 


\section{Related Work}
DMDL is a graphical programming language designed for the purpose of developing and implementing
MAC protocols in a swift and flexible manner whilst being platform-independent. DMDL models
MAC protocols as a Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM)~\cite{hfsm} in which each state is
described by a Synchronous Dataflow Graph (SDF)~\cite{sdf}. This has the advantage over more
traditional models of facilitating cross-layer optimization and providing a better concurrency
model. Additionally, its modular approach to protocol design ensures high code reusability and
flexibility.

The main components of DMDL are blocks, commands and ports. The blocks correspond to actors
in an SDF graph and they perform basic MAC functions such as carrier sensing and framing.
Commands correspond to the tokens in an SDF graph and they are consumed or produced by input
and output ports, respectively. Any given block has a number of mandatory ports which must
be used if the block is to function, and a number of optional ports that the developer may
use if additional functionality of the block is desired.


There are several frameworks for graphically programming SDRs. Arguably, the to most notable
ones are~\cite{labview} and GNU Radio~\cite{gr}, which mainly target the
Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)~\cite{usrp} SDR platform. However, they do not
provide any formal framework for MAC protocol development. Due to the licensing costs of LabVIEW
and the cost of USRP hardware, some developers might see limited use of these frameworks.

By providing a browser-based DE for DMDL that is platform independent, a framework can be provided
to actors otherwise unable to utilize LabVIEW and/or USRP such as small companies or research
groups with limited funds. In a PaaS- or HaaS-like manner, SDR experiment rigs can be provided as a
service, SDRaaS if you will, thereby making an effort to promote swift MAC protocol development and
prototyping.

\section{Method}
As a web-based application, the DE consists solely of JavaScript (JS), HTML 5 and CSS 3 source
code. No web frameworks such as JQuery, React or Angular were used since the developer had no
prior experience with web development and therefore chose to keep everything as simple as possible
as a first iteration of developing the DE. The JS code mainly follows the EcmaScript 5 standard to
ensure compatibility even for older devices and browsers.

\subsection{Code Overview}
Figure~\ref{fig:uml} in Appendix~\ref{app:uml} shows a Universal Modeling Language (UML) diagram
for the DE and how the underlying JS classes interact. The blocks labeled Workspace, BlockEditor
and BlockMenu are the main HTML elements where most of the user interaction is done. The blocks
with underlined labels represent the DMDL components, namely blocks and ports. There is no
implementation of the DMDL command concept, which is why the corresponding blocks have a
dashed outline. Section~\ref{sec:details} describes the classes in more detail.

\subsection{DMDL Subclasses}
\label{sec:subclasses}
The structure of the code aims to separate the User Interface UI components and the DMDL components
into different classes in order to achieve a maintainable and easily extendable code base.
Furthermore, the DMDL classes are kept as minimal as possible in order for easy implementation
of new DMDL blocks or ports, the majority of the functionality (such as being drawn or being
dragged) sits within the corresponding superclasses, more info about them can be found in
Section~\ref{sec:details}. Fig.~\ref{fig:timer_src} shows the source code for the DMDL timer block.
It starts by calling the constructor of the block superclass with the coordinates at which the
block is created and a list of ports that are available to the block. After that is a list of 
configurable parameters for the block. Lastly, a number of strings are placed in an associative
array where each string represent how a parameter is configurable, what the options are and what
the default value is.
\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{timer_src.png}
    \caption{Source code for the Timer class' constructor.}
    \label{fig:timer_src}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Link Between DE and Other Software}
The DE can be used to create an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file that represents the
graph/protocol that the developer has created. The XML file is thought to serve as the main link
between the DE and other tools. XML was chosen since it is widely used to represent software
objects such as graphs or diagrams in professional development tools such as GNU Radio and
LabVIEW. The structure of the XML file was specifically designed for the DE.

The XML file structure is based on the notion of a netlist, which is commonly used within the
electronic design automation industry~\cite{netlist}. Subsection~\ref{sec:xml} discusses the
structure in more detail from an example.

\section{Implementation Details}
\label{sec:details}
The following section describes the roles of the JS classes that make up the DE.

\subsection{The Block Class}
The Block class defines the behavior that all the DMDL blocks share and represents a generic
DMDL block. Most importantly, this means how the blocks shall be drawn on the workspace canvas
and how they behave when they are about to be placed, when they are clicked or when they are being
dragged around. All the DMDL blocks inherit these properties from the Block class and define
some additional properties that represent their respective configuration possibilities and 
what port types are available.

\subsection{The Port Class}
Much like the Block class, the Port class defines the properties shared by all DMDL ports.
This consists of how the port is drawn on the workspace canvas, what happens when a port is
clicked, which parent block it belongs to and toggling of the state if the port is an optional
port for its parent.

\subsection{The BlockMenu Class}
There are three main HTML elements for the DE and the BlockMenu class make up the first.
Here, DMDL blocks can be selected for placement within the workspace canvas. The BlockMenu
is automatically updated if new DMDL block subclasses are added. In addition to block selection,
the BlockMenu also contains the buttons for performing a syntax check and for exporting the current
workspace to an XML file.

\subsection{The Workspace Class}
The second main HTML element is the Workspace class. It consists of an HTML 5 canvas element where
all the blocks, ports and wires are drawn out. The Workspace class uses their respective draw
methods to draw the elements and then paints out some extra features such as marking regions if
a block or port has been clicked or if a block is about to be placed. Determining which block will
be selected for configuration is also done here by listening for which block the user has clicked
most recently, if any.

\subsection{The BlockEditor Class}
The third and last main HTML element is the BlockEditor class. If a user has not clicked any block
it is empty. Otherwise, it is filled up with the configurations that are available to the block in
the workspace that the user has clicked on most recently. Which ports the block will have are
selected through check buttons and mandatory ports will have their check buttons disabled. What
other configurations that can be made depends on the type of block but there are currently three
ways of inputting configurations. These are radio buttons for enumerations, slider for integer
ranges and check buttons for boolean values.

\subsection{The Wire Class}
The Wire class is a very small class which represent a wire between two blocks. The class is
instantiated every time the user successfully draws a wire in the canvas. The properties of
the Wire class consist of a method that describes how a wire is drawn and properties that
contain a wire object's start and end port. A wire can only be connected to two ports, but it
does not matter if it is between two input ports, two output ports or one of each.

\subsection{The Net Class}
Objects of the Net class represent a net in the graph. In this context a net is defined as a subset
of the entire set of wires that contains all wires that can be traversed without going through a
block. A wire can only belong to one net and a net must consist of at least one wire. The union of
all nets in a graph make up the entire set of wires for the same graph. Fig.~\ref{fig:net}
shows a simple graph consisting of two nets. Since the XML file that can be exported with the DE
is heavily based on this concept of a net, the Net class is also the class that is responsible
for exporting the XML file.

\subsection{The Syntax Checker Class}
The Syntax Checker class consists of a number of static functions for checking different types
of errors in the graph. The functions are called in sequence to check for one type of error
at a time and an error message is stitched together if any errors are encountered to provide
the user with feedback. At the time of writing, one such method has been fully implemented.
More details of what has been implemented can be found in Section~\ref{sec:syntax}. The
syntax check is either invoked by pressing the Syntax Check button within the BlockMenu
element or when trying to export a graph. A failed syntax check will prevent an export.

\section{Results and Analysis}
Fig.~\ref{fig:full_editor} shows a screenshot of the Aloha protocol~\cite{aloha} implemented
in the DE. To the left is the block menu, where the user selects which type of block will be
placed. The rightmost element is where the configuration of placed blocks is performed. The
block being configured is chosen by clicking on it, which also marks it with a green rectangle.
The middle element is the main workspace where blocks are dragged around and were wires are
drawn. Wires are drawn by left-clicking on a port and moving the mouse over to another port and
then releasing the button. The process of wiring can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:wiring}.

The DE has been tested to work in the browsers Firefox 64.0, Chromium 71.0 and Epiphany 3.28.

\begin{figure}[!t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{full_editor.png}
    \caption{A screenshot of the Aloha protocol~\cite{aloha} implemented in the DE.}
    \label{fig:full_editor}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{wiring.png}
    \caption{The process of drawing a wire between two ports.}
    \label{fig:wiring}
\end{figure}

\subsection{XML Structure}
\label{sec:xml}
Exporting the drawn graph to an XML file is done in the Net class through a static function.
The net class keeps track of which ports are connected to each other. If one is able to
travel from one port to another over wires without going through any blocks, the ports
belong to the same net. Fig.~\ref{fig:net} shows the two nets present in a graph representing
a Poisson source.

\begin{figure}[!t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{poisson_nets.png}
    \caption{A graph representing a Poisson source with its two nets pointed out.}
    \label{fig:net}
\end{figure}

The exported XML mainly consists of a number of block entries, one for each block in the graph.
Fig.~\ref{fig:xml} shows the the XML code for the top right block in Fig.~\ref{fig:net}. Here
follows a rundown of the segments of the block entry in Fig.~\ref{fig:xml}:
\begin{figure}[!t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{poisson_block-crop.pdf}
    \caption{XML code for the top-right timer block in Fig.~\ref{fig:net}.}
    \label{fig:xml}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Basic Info - Blue Segment}
This segment contains the most basic info about the block, namely
what type of block it is and its unique ID in the current project.

\subsubsection{Configurations - Purple Segment}
This segment contains information on how the block has been configured. Note
the similarity to associative array entries in Fig.~\ref{fig:timer_src}.

\subsubsection{Port List - Brown Segment}
This segment contains a list of all ports that are connected to a net. Every port entry contains
the port type, what mode it is operating in (some ports can operate as both inputs and outputs)
and what net the port is connected to. Ports can be connected to at most one net. Ports that
are not connected to any net do not show up here. The color coding of the net-entries correspond
to the colors of the annotations in Fig.~\ref{fig:net}.

\subsection{Syntax Check}
\label{sec:syntax}
The DE can detect one basic error of syntactic character. This error occurs when a port is
disabled after it has had wires attached to it. This type of error is shown by the wire turning
red. The user is also alerted of this error, if it exists, when clicking the ''Syntax Check''
or ''Export'' button. This error also prevents the user from exporting the graph to an XML file.

\section{Conclusion}
A web-based DE for DMDL has been developed. It is lightweight and written in pure JS, CSS and HTML.
The interface follows a standard drag-and-drop style that is common for graphical programming
languages such as DMDL. The DE also allows the developer to export an XML file that represents the
graph that defines the behavior of the developer's protocol. This XML file has the potential to
be used within a wide variety of frameworks and platforms for digital radio research and
development.

\section{Future Work}
As there are many ways of doing wireless protocol simulation, prototyping and implementation, the
DE needs to be extended with intermediate layers of software in order to provide the user with
the platform independence and flexibility that DMDL promises. Important examples of this
intermediate software include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define an XML schema for the XML file that the DE exports. This is to facilitate
          future work with the XML file such as using it for code generation. It is also a
          suitable way to document the XML file's structure.
    \item Frameworks such as GNU Radio and LabVIEW use XML to describe work done by the user.
          By writing software that converts between the DE's XML format and other formats, the
          DE can be connected to larger frameworks that support programming of SDR platforms.
    \item A custom backend that can simulate the user's protocol. This way, the user can
          see the general behavior of a protocol at an early stage in a truly
          platform-independent and easily accessible way.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.

\section{Project Milestones}
\label{app:milestones}
The development of the DE had a project structure with a number of milestones marking the
expected completion date of certain central functionality of the DE. Most of the milestones
were met on time with the exception of four milestones. This was due to an increased workload
in another project, caused the development for the DE to stall for roughly two weeks in
mid-December. These task were instead completed in early-to-mid January. Table~\ref{tab:milestones} shows an overview of the milestones.
